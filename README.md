Bank Account Simulation

This is a simple Banking Application written in Java that simulates basic banking operations. The project demonstrates concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

The application is structured into three main files:
account.java – Defines the Account class, handling account details and transactions.
bank.java – Defines the Bank class, managing multiple accounts.
bankingapp.java – The main application file containing the program’s entry point.

Features
Create and manage bank accounts
Deposit money into an account
Withdraw money with balance validation
